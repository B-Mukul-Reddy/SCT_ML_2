#Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how K-Means clustering can be used to perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior. Using the mall_customers.csv dataset from a retail store, we analyze customer data to uncover distinct segments, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

Problem Statement
Understanding customer behavior is essential for data-driven marketing. By segmenting customers, businesses can:

Identify key customer groups with similar purchasing habits.
Develop personalized marketing strategies that target each segment effectively.
Optimize marketing efforts to increase customer retention and satisfaction.
This project leverages the K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize customers based on annual income and spending scores, providing actionable insights into customer demographics and spending behaviors.

Dataset
The dataset, mall_customers.csv, contains anonymized data on customer demographics and purchasing behavior, including:

CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to each customer
Gender: Customer's gender
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$): Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the store based on purchasing behavior and loyalty
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Loaded and cleaned the data, focusing on relevant features: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100).
Feature Scaling: Standardized the selected features for better clustering performance.
Optimal Cluster Selection: Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k), balancing simplicity and accuracy.
K-Means Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering with the optimal k value to group customers into distinct clusters.
Visualization: Visualized clusters in a scatter plot to interpret customer segments.
Results
By analyzing the clusters, we identified groups of customers with varying income levels and spending behaviors. These insights can guide targeted marketing strategies and resource allocation.

Example Insights
High Income, Low Spending: Customers who may need incentive programs to encourage spending.
Low Income, High Spending: Value-seeking customers who are highly engaged.
Balanced Income-Spending Groups: Stable customers likely to respond to loyalty programs.
Applications
Targeted Marketing: Design campaigns for each segment, such as loyalty rewards for high-spenders and discounts for potential customers.
Product Recommendation: Offer personalized product recommendations based on spending behavior and income.
Customer Retention: Identify at-risk groups and create retention programs for better engagement.
